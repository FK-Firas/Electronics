        Calculate the weight of an object on several planets, 
        given the gravitational constants for a few planets and the forumla
        needed to calculate the weight on the respective planets.
        To calculate the weight on all other planets, the following is required:
        
        1.  The weight on Earth
        2.  the gravitational constant for each planet:
            a.  Venus 0.91
            b.  Mars 0.38
            c.  Jupiter 2.34
            d.  Saturn 0.93
        3.  Weight on Planet = weight on Earth * graviational constant on specific planet
    
        Ask the user for a weight of an object on Earth 
        and determine how much that object weighs on Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn.
        
        The output should look like for a 190 pound object as follows:
    
        "Object's weight on Earth is 190 pounds."
        "Object's weight on Venus is xxx pounds."
        "Object's weight on Mars is yyy pounds."
        "Object's weight on Jupiter is zzz pounds."
        "Object's weight on Saturn is aaaa pounds."
